# Omniscient Traffic Lights

Using speed limits, and crowd communication between the travellers and the on route traffic lights, traffic light timings and travellers speed was determined and theoretical time saving of 50% was achieved. The simulation was created using python, and the research was done within the scope of the course. GA was custom coded and no prebuilt code was utilized.


Full report with results is included in this github repo.


This project was done under mentorship with Prof Otman Basir for ECE 499. 
Due to covid illness I was unable to test the system with real time data from actuall streets of Waterloo.

Perhaps in a future instance we can conduct tests to help achieve the larger goal of smart city traffic lights.
