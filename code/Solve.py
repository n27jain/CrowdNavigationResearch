# given a map
# give a route
# we must minimize travel time by adjusting out speed
# Delay = time at traffic light + expect start up delay 
#Letâ€™s assume that there is an additional penalty for stopping at a red light. There usually is a 2 second delay reaction before cars can reach the expected average speed of the coming road.
