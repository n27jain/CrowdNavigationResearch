# given a map

# give a route

# we must minimize travel time by adjusting out speed


# Delay = time at traffic light + expect start up delay 

#Letâ€™s assume that there is an additional penalty for stopping at a red light. There usually is a 2 second delay reaction before cars can reach the expected average speed of the coming road.
